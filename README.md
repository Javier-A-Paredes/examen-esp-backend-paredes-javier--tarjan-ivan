Microservices Commercial Functionality Assignment
=================================================

Overview
--------

This final project is dedicated to ensuring the robust commercial functionality of microservices by focusing on key elements such as proficient Java programming, adherence to encapsulation principles, structured JSON data exchange, and the implementation of essential microservices technologies with the help of Spring Cloud Netflix.

### Microservices Names

-   `api-catalog`
-   `api-movie`
-   `api-serie`
-   `api-gateway`

Requirements
------------

### Java Programming and Encapsulation

Ensure the correct functionality of microservices by implementing the following:

-   Proper Java classes with required functionalities.
-   Methods and attributes that respect encapsulation principles.

### JSON Structure

Implement a proper JSON structure for data exchange within the microservices.

### Layered Architecture

Adopt a layered architecture for each API, including:

-   Data Layer: Utilize MongoDB for data storage.
-   Data Access (Repository) Layer: Implement data access using ORM/JPA.
-   Service Layer: Develop a service layer.
-   Control Layer (Controller): Implement the control layer.

### Microservices Architecture

Implement a microservices architecture with the following features:

-   Distributed Configuration: Configure microservices with Config Server.
-   Service Discovery: Enable autodiscovery of microservices with Eureka.
-   API Gateway: Implement an API Gateway.
-   Load Balancing: Utilize Load Balancer for distributing the load.
-   Feign: Use Feign for communication between microservices.
-   Asynchronous Messaging: Implement asynchronous messaging between microservices using RabbitMQ
